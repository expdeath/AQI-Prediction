# AQI-Prediction
This explores the prediction of Air Quality Index (AQI) in India using Random Forest Regressor and SVM. The research question is well-defined and relevant, focusing on an important public health and environmental issue. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and data transformation, was effectively implemented. Random Forest Regressor delivered strong predictive performance, highlighting its robustness for the task. However, the geographic and temporal scope of the dataset was limited, which impacts the generalizability of the findings. The discussion of trade-offs and alternative models could have been more detailed to enrich the analysis.
